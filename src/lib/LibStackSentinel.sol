type Sentinel is uint256;

/// Rainlang has no dynamic list data type as every stack item MUST be explicit
/// in the structure of the code itself. While it would be possible for users to
/// manually code length prefixes into the stack, this would be error prone and
/// generally hostile to the overall DX. Instead we can allow sentinels as an
/// option that is merely awkward rather than downright pathological.
///
/// Rainlang authors can use a single sentinel value that is constant across all
/// their expressions rather than a calculated length prefix. This value can even
/// be aliased in onchain metadata and referenced by name for ease of use. The
/// calling contract defines and consumes sentinels, so the expression author
/// does not need to be aware of or have control over any subtleties in choice of
/// sentinel.
///
/// The main tradeoffs for sentinel terminated lists on a stack are similar to
/// null-terminated strings,
/// as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string)
///
/// > While simple to implement, this representation has been prone to errors and
/// > performance problems.
///
/// This library attempts to mitigate potential implementation errors with a
/// standard implementation that has been fuzzed and optimized for building lists
/// of tuples (and therefore lists of structs via. a direct type cast). The main
/// implementation issues in null-terminated strings are avoided:
///
/// - Using any sentinel value other than `0`, such as the hash of some well
///   known string, will avoid misinterpreting unallocated memory as a sentinel.
/// - Any underflows manifest as either a "missing sentinel" or infinite loop,
///   which will revert either way due to an explicit check or gas limits.
/// - Given that a sentinel is `uint256` it is possible to construct a value that
///   is very unlikely to collide with real values in the implementation domain.
/// - Well behaved integrity checks will ensure the memory for the sentinel is
///   allocated as any other stack item.
///
/// Sadly there is no way to avoid the O(n) performance overhead of searching for
/// a sentinel vs. O(1) of reading a length prefix directly. This is somewhat
/// mitigated by the nature of a hand-written stack being small in
/// computing terms, and that each item being iterated over is an entire struct
/// rather than individual stack values. Assembly is used to keep the looping
/// overhead to a minimum.
